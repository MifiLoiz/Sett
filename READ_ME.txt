Welcome to our respitory for the game SET! 

Here, we will explain what can be expected from this respitory and what where can be found. 


Goal of Sett
--- 
The goal of this respitory was coding the game SET, in the coding language Python. We are happy with the results and we hope the reader will too! 
 

Manual of the game
--- 
A step-bu-step manual can be found in the file: 
	Manual_SET.pdf. 
This manual takes the reader through the steps of setting up the game and special features. 


Classes 
--- 
The game runs on a few classes and we organized them as follows. 

The file: 	class_card.py
codes the class Cards, which adds features to objects so they represent cards of the game SET. 

The file: 	class_set_pygame.py 
creates the interactive part of the game, using pygame. This file will be run when the user plays the game.
Interesting to add is the file: 
	constants.py
which holds many variables that are used across the files.  

The file: 	class_setalgorithms.py
makes the rules of the game SET and will be used in the background when running class_set_pygame.py. 


Pictures
--- 
To make the game interesting and appealing to the eye, we used some pictures. 
The respitory "kaarten" contains all 81 cards of the game. 


Remaining files
--- 
Some files are not yet mentioned. 

The file: 	Set_probability_calculator_no_set.py 
is a nice piece of code, which main purpose is showing that 21 cards will guarantee a valid SET on the table. 

The file: 	stand_alone_code.py 
contains some code that was used but did not fit a file that was already created.
